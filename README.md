Data Storytelling Project - Airline Delay Storytelling
This link will take to you to

Using the pictorial analysis i will explain the following; 
The History of FLight Experience in the Past: There were over 44% flight from the total number of flight in the airport delayed, this is mot a good one though.
How Bad was Delayed Flight:  The first page tells us that there was more delays during weekdays compared to weekends, this delays will inturn affect people businesses.
Any identified Pattern with Delayed Flights: I realised that Airlines that have more Flight experienced more Delays. 
Any Possibile Recomendations: I will advise that Airlines with more Flights should be checked if they can handle it the situation and then problems should be solved as soon as possible.
