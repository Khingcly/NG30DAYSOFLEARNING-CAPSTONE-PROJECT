Using the pictorial analysis i will explain the following;       
The History of FLight Experience in the Past: There were over 44% flight from the total number of flight in the airport delayed, this is mot a good one though.  
How Bad was Delayed Flight:  The first page tells us that there was more delays during weekdays compared to weekends, this delays will inturn affect people businesses.               
Any identified Pattern with Delayed Flights: I realised that Airlines that have more Flight experienced more Delays.      
Any Possibile Recomendations: I will advise that Airlines with more Flights should be checked if they can handle it the situation and then problems should be solved as soon as possible.
