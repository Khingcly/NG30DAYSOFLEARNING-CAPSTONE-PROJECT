Data Storytelling Project - Airline Delay Storytelling
Link to my story -https://bit.ly/3BaKpqs

Using the Pictorial Analysis i will explain the following;       
The History of Flight Experience in the Past: There were over 44% flight from the total number of flight in the airport delayed, this is mot a good one though.  
How Bad was Delayed Flight:  The first page tells us that there was more delays during weekdays compared to weekends, this delays will inturn affect people businesses.               
Any Identified Pattern with Delayed Flights: I realised that Airlines that have more Flight experienced more Delays.      
Any Possible Recomendations: I will advise that Airlines with more Flights should be checked if they can handle it the situation and then problems should be solved as soon as possible.
